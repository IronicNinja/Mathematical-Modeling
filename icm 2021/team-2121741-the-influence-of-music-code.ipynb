In the first section, we analyze the inherent similarities of music within and between genres using a K-Means clustering algorithm and visualize the data using T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding dimensionality reduction. We continue by analyzing which genres have music most similar to each other (aside from themselves). To do so, we utilize a Pearson correlation matrix and plot the genres with significant correlation on a bar chart.\n\nIn the second section, we devise a novel method of calculating influence scores by combining a breadth-first search algorithm with an exponential decay function, and then plot the top influence scores on a bar chart. We also extract the timeframe of an influencer influencing a follower and create meaningful subnetwork visualizations using NetworkX.\n\nIn the third section, we analyze whether influencers have a significant impact on their followers by deploying a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. We observe that influencers should have similar music to their followers if there is true influence, and therefore they should be neighbors with one another when plotted in multi-dimensional space. \n\nIn the fourth section, we built a predictive model using XGBoost and extracted the most important & distinguishing features for genre prediction. We supplemented our feature importance analysis with alternative statistical testing.\n\nIn the fifth and final section, we explored trends in how songs characteristics have changed over time and connected them to real world events and explanations. We made observations about trends for all songs, and also specifically analyzed Rhythm and Blues (R&B) and its most influential artists.\n\nThrough these analyses, we hope to enlighten the reader on the influence of music through networks and how music has changed over time using a combination of math, computer science, and of course, music.\n\n<h2> Problem Statement </h2>\n\nProblem Statement: https://www.comap-math.com/mcm/2021_ICM_Problem_D.pdf\n\nMusic has the power to culturally, morally, and emotionally influence our society. The sound and messages artists release through their art form directly impact their followers and listeners in powerful ways (Huang, 2014). In an effort to better understand the impact of music on musical artists and society, we have been asked by the Integrative Collective Music (ICM) Society to analyze musical influence across time, genres, and artists. The primary focus of this paper is to capture revolutionary changes, extraneous circumstances, and influential artists using illustrative visualizations and analyses.\n\n<h2> Important Definitions </h2>\n\n* **Cluster:** A group of data tightly packed together in some dimension.\n* **Feature:** Analogous to ‚Äúcharacteristic‚Äù. This notation is used interchangeably throughout the paper.\n* **Primary artist features:** ['danceability', 'energy', 'valence', 'tempo', 'loudness', 'mode', 'key', 'acousticness', 'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'speechiness', 'duration_ms', 'popularity', 'count']\n* **Z-score:** A standard unit of measurement. Each sample x in our dataset is scaled down to z-scores using the formula z = x-Œº/ùúé, where Œº is the mean and ùúé is the standard deviation.\n\n<h2> Problem Assumptions </h2>\n\n* **Assumption 1:** The data given in the datasets ‚Äúinfluence_data‚Äù, ‚Äúfull_musics_data‚Äù, ‚Äúdata_by_artist‚Äù, and ‚Äúdata_by_year‚Äù is accurate.\n    * **Reasoning:** The efficacy of our analysis is largely dependent on the accuracy of the data. Because we cannot use any other data in this paper, we must assume that the data provided to us is correct.\n* **Assumption 2:** Each feature in the dataset has equal weighting; normalizing the data using z-scores is sufficient for analysis.\n    * **Reasoning:** There‚Äôs no reasonable way to weigh certain features heavier than others.\n* **Assumption 3:** Two genres or artists being similar is defined by and only by the inherent characteristics in their music, and not by extraneous factors such as genre and song title.\n    * **Reasoning:** The whole purpose of using these numerical features is to analyze whether there are inherent similarities between genres/artists.\n* **Assumption 4:** Drop song and artists in the genre ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù and ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs‚Äù.\n    * **Reasoning:** There are only 3 artists labeled under ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù and 4 artists labeled under ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs‚Äù, compared to the 5653 total artists in the data.\n\n<h2> Appendices/Other Resources </h2>\n\n* Prediction models notebook (to separate GPU usage): https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/the-influence-of-music-prediction-models\n* Officially submitted paper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GxArjRCE95swOcifBco8uLnS9-ABKzQetMoKBTBmtWA/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"General Data Science Packages\"\"\"\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport sys\n\n\"\"\"Graphing Packages\"\"\"\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport networkx as nx\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n\"\"\"Other Useful Libraries\"\"\"\nimport random\nimport math\nimport itertools\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\nfrom sklearn.metrics import euclidean_distances\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GroupKFold, StratifiedKFold, RepeatedStratifiedKFold\nimport multiprocessing\nimport scipy\n\nLOOK_AT = 10\nSEED = 42\nnp.random.seed(SEED)\nrandom.seed(SEED)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_by_artist = pd.read_csv(\"../input/icm-problem-d/2021_ICM_Problem_D_Data/data_by_artist.csv\")\ndata_by_year = pd.read_csv(\"../input/icm-problem-d/2021_ICM_Problem_D_Data/data_by_year.csv\")\nfull_music_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/icm-problem-d/2021_ICM_Problem_D_Data/full_music_data.csv\")\ninfluence_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/icm-problem-d/2021_ICM_Problem_D_Data/influence_data.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Task #1: Similarities Within and Between Genres\n\nNotes: We use artist names instead of ID; when exploring the data, we noticed that some artists (grouped by names) were counted in more than 1 genre, but when using artists (grouped by ID), artists were surjective.

The invention of the computer in 1943 could also explain this large growth in song production, as computers could be used to produce, advertise, and sell music more easily. The years with the highest number of songs were in the 1960s, which coincides with the invention of cassette tapes (Kendall, 2017). These would have provided more access to songs to more people, as well as facilitate the selling and production of music.

Given the graphs of these features over time, we looked at important changes that indicated musical revolutions.\n\nThe most apparent change of music was in the 1960s, where the acousticness of music dropped heavily. This identified one of the most important revolutions in music history, when electric guitars and amplification became a mainstay in popular music. Following this, acousticness continued to decline with the introduction of synthesizers and sampling.\n\nExplicitness also rose over time, most notably in the past decade, and this actually indicated a revolution in how music reaches its listeners. In the age of radio, stations censored lyrics and generally discouraged explicitness. However, with the explosion of streaming services in the past few years, musicians that publish to these services are freer to use explicit language in their songs (Ross, 2017).\n\nLoudness also followed a steady upwards trend, which indicated a musical phenomenon referred to as the ‚Äúloudness war‚Äù. Throughout time, producers continued to drive up the loudness of their songs, as louder songs generally stood out more compared to quieter ones (NPR). In the 1990s, the arrival of digital signal processing allowed producers to drive up loudness even more, which correlated with increasing loudness on the graph.\n\nFinally, we noticed that valence followed a downwards trend. Similarly we calculated the average mode each year, and that also followed a downwards trend. Since a mode of 0 indicated a minor key, and minor keys are generally less bright than major keys, we took this as another indicator of decreasing positivity. Though this pattern was interesting, it was difficult to connect it to any specific events, perhaps it indicated that people are generally more negative recently, or that sad music has become more trendy.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3> Extra TSNE Reduced Graph Over Time </h3>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"music_by_year = music_df.groupby('year').mean()\ntsne_pipeline = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), ('tsne', TSNE(n_components=2, random_state=SEED))])\nX = music_by_year.to_numpy()\ngenre_embedding = tsne_pipeline.fit_transform(X)\nprojection_year = pd.DataFrame(columns=['x', 'y'], data=genre_embedding)\nprojection_year['year'] = music_by_year.index\nprojection_year","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.scatter(projection_year, x='x', y='y', color='year', hover_data=['x', 'y', 'year'])\nfig.update_layout(title={'text': \"Yearly Progressing in Music After Dimensionality Reduction\", 'x': 0.5,\n                             'xanchor': 'center', 'font': {'size': 20}})\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Potential code for adding genre labels."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(name=\"years\", x=projection_year['x'], y=projection_year['y'], text=projection_year['year'], marker_color=projection_year['year'], \n                               marker=dict(colorbar=dict(title=\"year\")), mode='markers'))\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(name='genres', x=mean_projection['x'], y=mean_projection['y'], text=mean_projection['genre'], mode='markers'))\nfig.update_layout(title={'text': \"Yearly Progressing in Music After Dimensionality Reduction\", 'x': 0.5,\n                             'xanchor': 'center', 'font': {'size': 20}})\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3> Specific Genre Analysis - R&B; </h3>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"normalized_music_genre = normalized_music.groupby(['Genre', 'year']).mean()\nfig = px.line(normalized_music_genre.loc['R&B;'][song_features])\nfig.update_layout(title={'text': \"Features for R&B; Over Time\", 'x': 0.5,\n                             'xanchor': 'center', 'font': {'size': 20}}, yaxis_title=\"Z Score\")\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"genres = []\nfor i in range(len(influence_df)):\n    my_set = id_genre_dict[influence_df.loc[i]['Influencer']]\n    for genre in my_set:\n        genres.append(genre)\n        break","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"influence_genre_df = influence_df.copy()\ninfluence_genre_df['genre'] = genres\nvis_figure(influence_genre_df.loc[influence_genre_df['genre'] == 'R&B;'], LOOK_AT)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Finally, we noticed that valence followed a downwards trend.

Though this pattern was interesting, it was difficult to connect it to any specific events, perhaps it indicated that people are generally more negative recently, or that sad music has become more trendy.\n\n(Additionally, we noticed that popularity followed an upwards trend, but since the popularity metric was based on recent listeners, it seemed obvious that the more recent songs would be more popular.)\n\nFinally, we analyzed genre and artist-specific trends (Fig, 25-26). We focused on R&B, and found a strong downwards trend in the average acousticness. Then, we filtered songs in R&B to only ones authored by James Brown, the most influential in the genre according to our metrics, and we found the same downwards trend. It was hard to establish whether he caused this trend though, especially considering the small amount of data we had for the artist. (The graphs are not necessarily depicted here)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n\nFrom our K-Means clustering analyses, we find that artists are much more similar within genres than between genres. From our Pearson‚Äôs Correlation matrix, we also find that certain genres are more closely related feature wise to each other than to other genres (Fig 5). Using a data network, we were able to model the influence of artists, and we found that the most influential artists were The Beatles.\n\nUsing a KNN algorithm, we were able to measure the similarity between influencers and their followers. We found that influencers seem to influence their followers more than followers are influenced by their influencers. However, in all there are not that many significant similarities between the music of influencers and their followers. We also determined the features that distinguish genres from each other. By using the standard deviation of the features across genres, we found that instrumentalness was the best feature to distinguish between genres.\n\nBy analyzing the changes in song number, genre popularity, and song features over time, we were able to attribute some of these changes to certain historical events. For example, the rise of new technologies like the cassette tape and CD in the second half of the 20th century sparked rapid growth in music production, and the formation of the Beatles marked the rise of the pop/rock genre.\n\nAdditionally, we found that the popularization of the electric guitar led to a drop in the acousticness of songs, and the popularization of music streaming platforms led to higher explicitness in songs. Finally, we connected trends in genres to major influencers in those genres, for example, we observed that a decrease in the overall acousticness of R&B coincided with a decrease in the acousticness of James Brown‚Äôs songs.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References\n\nLinks for the references are at the bottom of the official paper.\n\n* Dabbura, I.
